This is a collaborative project for SWEN303 - User Interface Design at Victoria University of Wellington. Currently there are 3 active collaborators: Donald Tang Scott Willan Chris Jacques

For our 300 level project, we are to design and implement an online marketplace similar to etsy or TradeMe. This course is mostly focused on frontend and not backend so it will be very insecure.
